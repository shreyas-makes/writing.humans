# AI Suggestions Troubleshooting Guide

## Why AI Suggestions Might Not Appear

### 1. **OpenAI API Key Not Configured** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Most Common Issue**
- Go to Settings page (`/settings`)
- Add your OpenAI API key
- Verify the green checkmark appears: "‚úì API key is configured and ready to use"

### 2. **Content Requirements Not Met** üìù
- **First suggestion**: Triggers after 2 lines of content or 60+ characters (300ms delay)
- **Copy-paste detection**: Immediate suggestions for pasted content (200ms delay)
- **Subsequent suggestions**: Every 3 minutes for content changes
- **Fallback protection**: 30+ characters if 2-line detection fails (800ms delay)
- Content cannot be the default placeholder: "Start writing your document here..."

### 3. **Maximum Suggestions Reached** üìä
- Check if you've reached the max suggestions limit (default: 3)
- Accept or reject existing suggestions to make room for new ones
- Adjust max suggestions in Settings if needed

### 4. **AI Panel or Blue Indicators Hidden** üëÅÔ∏è
- Ensure the AI panel is open (eye icon in header)
- Check that blue indicators toggle is enabled (switch in header)
- Blue dots should appear in the right margin of the editor

### 5. **Network or API Issues** üåê
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify your OpenAI API key has sufficient credits
- Check if OpenAI API is accessible from your network

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs
Open browser developer tools (F12) and look for:
- `üîç generateSuggestions called with:` - Shows if the function is being called
- `‚ùå No OpenAI API key found` - API key missing
- `‚ùå Content too short or is placeholder` - Content requirements not met
- `üéØ Received AI suggestions:` - Shows if OpenAI returned suggestions
- `‚úÖ Added suggestions to state` - Confirms suggestions were added

### Step 2: Verify Settings
1. Go to `/settings`
2. Check API key status
3. Review suggestion timing information:
   - **First suggestion**: Triggers after 2 lines of content (300ms delay)
   - **Copy-paste detection**: Immediate suggestions for pasted content (200ms delay)
   - **Subsequent suggestions**: Every 3 minutes for content changes
   - **Fallback protection**: 30+ characters if 2-line detection fails (800ms delay)

### Step 3: Test with Sample Content
Replace editor content with:
```
This is a sample document with enough content to trigger AI suggestions. The artificial intelligence system should analyze this text and provide helpful editing recommendations to improve clarity, conciseness, and overall quality.
```

### Step 4: Check Debug Panel
In development mode, the AI panel shows debug information including:
- API Key status
- Current suggestion count
- Generation status
- Any errors
- Content length
